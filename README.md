COA Take-Home Challenge

## Overview
The document provides an overview of a take-home coding challenge for the COA Taskforce. The challenge involves building an interactive photo gallery based on Figma designs and completing two coding challenges that test logical thinking and coding aptitude.

## Project Requirements
Responsive Design: The photo gallery should adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
Figma Design Accuracy: The implementation should match the provided Figma designs pixel-perfectly.
Hover Interaction: Implement the hover interaction shown in the Figma prototype, displaying additional details when a user hovers over a photo.
Cross-browser Compatibility: Ensure consistent performance across modern web browsers.
Code Quality: Write clean, readable, and well-structured code, following best practices and conventions.
Coding Challenges

## 1. Array Manipulation
Problem Statement: Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target.
Solution: The solution is implemented in the arrayMap.js file and meets the following requirements:
Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
Space complexity: O(1).

## 2. String Transformation
Problem Statement: Transform a given string based on the following rules:
If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), perform both operations in the specified order.
Solution: The solution is implemented in the stringTransform.js file and meets the following requirements:
Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string.
Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string.

## Conclusion
The take-home challenge aims to assess the candidate's skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and problem-solving abilities. The successful completion of the interactive photo gallery and coding challenges will be evaluated based on code quality, adherence to best practices, functionality, and performance.
